Full stack project for technical test.
It consists on to do task cration, adition, modification and deletion.


I'm using docker-compose for generating MySQL container and volume and PHP_Mysqdmin for a better visual data structure.

*FRONT-END: I'm using Angular v15.0 (latest version), bootstrap v5 for styling (popper, jquery, bootstrap css and js, and bootstrap icons), RxJS for async methods.
*BACK-END: Apart from MySQL docker container to simulate database for Tasks, I will be using NodeJS Express, MySQL2, JWT (Json Web Token), dotenv, and cors for making endpoint calls from different URL (and giving the possibility to use it in a mobile application).
